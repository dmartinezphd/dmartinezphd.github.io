### About Me

<img src="/assets/images/profile4.jpg" alt="DMM" width="150"/>

<blockquote class="full-width"><p>Daniel M. Martínez, PhD<br>Engineer, Scientist, Author</p></blockquote>

I am a chemical engineer, environmental scientist, and published author, with a passion for research and writing about thermodynamics, environmental science, technology, and data analysis. 

All of my degrees are in Chemical Engineering (BS/MS/PHD) and I have navigated a diverse career as a NASA scientist studying how metals condense, as a postdoctoral fellow studying energy-society linkages, and as an environmental science professor doing scholarly work and teaching courses in energy sustainability, atmospheric science, and environmental quantitative reasoning. Recently, I decided to leave my academic institution to pursue research full time, operating through my LLC, Random Walk Research. I'm particularly (but not exclusively) interested in ground and space-based sensing of the atmosphere and how it impacts weather, climate, and health. 

### News
* 2022/09 --- Left USM and Formed Random Walk Research LLC


### Relevant Education

#### Undergraduate
BS Chemical Engineering; University of Rochester (1999)

#### Graduate
PhD Chemical Engineering; University of Rochester (2007)

### Relevant Experience

#### NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (2000-2007)
* After my 1-year PhD residency requirement at UR, I spent the balance of my PhD doing research at NASA-Goddard's Code 691 (Astrochemistry), first as a Graduate Student Researchers Program Fellow and then as a NASA Co-Op, which was an immediate path to federal employment

#### University of Rochester and AHEAD Energy Corp (2007 - 2008)
* I left NASA in 2007 to start a family with my wife back in Rochester. During that year I worked with Ben Ebenhack, a lecturer at UR and founder of AHEAD Energy, and that is where I began my journey studying energy systems, sustainability and energy transition theory. 

#### University of Southern Maine (2008 - 2022)
* After one year back in Rochester, we decided to move to Maine. I connected with USM's Department of Environmental Science and started out as a part-time research professor. I eventually received a full-time offer that was renewed until I applied for and received a promotion to Associate Research Professor.

### Useful Skills I Picked Up During My Journey
- Data analysis and Visualization with MS Excel (a way under-rated skill in my opinion)
- Writing book-length manuscripts
- Literature Review
- Proposal Writing
- Project Management
- Presenting and/or teaching diverse subject matter to informed and uninformed audiences
- Programming (BASIC, MathCad, a little C and FORTRAN)
- Protoype development
- Patience and tolerance for pain

### What I'm learning Now
- Data Science Fundamentals (Python, R, SQL)
- IOT sensor systems
- CubeSats
- How to run a successful research and consulting business
