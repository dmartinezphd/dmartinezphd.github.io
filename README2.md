## Hola, it's me, Daniel.

![Picture of ME](assets/images/profile.jpg)

I am a chemical engineer, environmental scientist, and published author, with a passion for research and writing about environmental science, technology, and data analysis. All of my degrees are in Chemical Engineering (BS/MS/PHD) and have benefited from a diverse career as a NASA scientist for seven years, as a postdoctoral fellow studying energy-society linkages, and as an Environmental Science Professor for 14 years doing scholarly work and teaching courses in energy sustainability, atmospheric science, and environmental quantitative reasoning. Recently, I decided to leave my academic institution to pursue research full time operating through my LLC Ranom Walk Research. While teaching was rewarding, my heart is in research and development and I want to spend this part of my career focusing on environmental sensor technology and data sceince. I'm particularly interested in ground and space-based sensing of the atmosphere and how it impacts weather, climate, and health

## Relevant Education

BS Chemical Engineering; University of Rochester (1999)

## Relevant Experience

NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (2000-2007)
- After my 1-year PhD residency requirement, I spent the balance of my PhD doing research at NASA-Goddard's Code 691 (Astrochemistry), first as a Graduate Student Researchers Program Fellow and then as a NASA Co-Op, which was an immediate path to federal employment
