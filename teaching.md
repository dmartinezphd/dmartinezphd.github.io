## Teaching
Over the 15 years that I taught (1 at UofR and 14 at USM) college level coursework, I have developed materials and problem sets that might be useful to someone out there. I'm no longer at a university, so the information on this website is for informational and recreational purposes only. Please let me know if any of the material I post fails to provide proper attribution.
