## Teaching
Over the 15 years that I taught university-level coursework (1 year at UofR and 14 years at USM), I have developed materials and problem sets that might be useful to someone out there. So, I'll be (slowly) populating course content onto Github to share with you. I'm no longer at a university, so the information on this website is for informational and recreational purposes only. Please let me know if any unoriginal material I post fails to provide proper attribution.
