## Hola, it's me, Daniel.

![Picture of ME](assets/images/profile.jpg)

I am a chemical engineer, environmental scientist, and published author, with a passion for research and writing about thermodynamics, environmental science, technology, and data analysis. All of my degrees are in Chemical Engineering (BS/MS/PHD) and have benefited from a diverse career as a NASA scientist, as a postdoctoral fellow studying energy-society linkages, and as an Environmental Science Professor doing scholarly work and teaching courses in energy sustainability, atmospheric science, and environmental quantitative reasoning. Recently, I decided to leave my academic institution to pursue research full time operating through my LLC Ranom Walk Research. While teaching was rewarding, my heart is in research and development and I want to spend this part of my career focusing on environmental sensor technology and data sceince. I'm particularly interested in ground and space-based sensing of the atmosphere and how it impacts weather, climate, and health. 

## Relevant Education

BS Chemical Engineering; University of Rochester (1999)

PhD Chemical Engineering; University of Rochester (2007)

## Relevant Experience

NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (2000-2007)
- After my 1-year PhD residency requirement at UR, I spent the balance of my PhD doing research at NASA-Goddard's Code 691 (Astrochemistry), first as a Graduate Student Researchers Program Fellow and then as a NASA Co-Op, which was an immediate path to federal employment

University of Rochester and AHEAD Energy Corp (2007 - 2008)
- I left NASA in 2007 to start a family with my wife back in Rochester. During that year I worked with Ben Ebenhack, a lecturer at UR and founder of AHEAD Energy, and that is where I began my journey studying energy systems, sustainability and energy transition theory. 

University of Southern Maine (2008 - 2022)
- After one year back in Rochester, we decided to move to Maine. I connected with USM's Department of Environmental Science and started out as a part-time research professor. I eventually received a full-time offer that was renewed until I applied for promotion with title Associate Research Professor.

## Useful Skills I Picked Up During My Journey
- Data analysis and Visualization with MS Excel (a way under-rated skill in my opinion)
- Programming (BASIC, MathCad, a little C and now learning Python)
- Literature Review
- Proposal Writing
- Project Management
- Presenting and/or teaching materials to informed and uninformed audiences
- Protoype development

## Final Thought
My greatest trait is that I am able to find solutions to problems that help gets a project "unstuck."
