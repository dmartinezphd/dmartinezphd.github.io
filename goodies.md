## Free Courses and Course Materials
Over the 15 years that I taught university-level coursework (1 year at UofR and 14 years at USM), I have developed materials and problem sets that might be useful to someone out there. So, I'll be (slowly) populating old and new course content onto Github to share with you. I'm no longer affiliated with a university, so the information on this website is for informational and recreational purposes only. Please let me know if any unoriginal material I post fails to provide proper attribution. Note that the energy curriculum was developed with partial support from the National Science Foundation's Division of Undergraduate Education (Award number 0941778) and also was informed by the hard work I did while writing my three books. I'll also post related topical content into the Further Study Required blog and LinkedIn articles. Here is a list of courses I've developed over the years. Click on individual titles to access the course materials.

- Sustainability and Global Energy Systems
- Energy Efficiency
- Renewable Energy
- Atmosphere
- Quantitative Reasoning and the Environment
- Air Pollution
- CubeSats: Small Spacecraft Systems
