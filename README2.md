## Hola, it's me, Daniel.

![Picture of ME](assets/images/profile.jpg)

I am a chemical engineer, environmental scientist, and published author, with a passion for research and writing about environmental science, technology, and data analysis. All of my degrees are in Chemical Engineering (BS/MS/PHD) and have benefited from a diverse career as a NASA scientist for seven years, as a postdoctoral fellow studying energy-society linkages, and as an Environmental Science Professor for 14 years doing scholarly work and teaching courses in energy sustainability, atmospheric science, and environmental quantitative reasoning. Recently, I decided to leave my academic institution to pursue research full time operating through my LLC Ranom Walk Research. While teaching was rewarding, my heart is in research and development and I want to spend this part of my career focusing on environmental sensor technology and data sceince. I'm particularly interested in ground and space-based sensing of the atmosphere for particulate matter and how it impacts weather, climate, and health. I'm also interested in helping others design, manage, and carry out research in STEM fields that align with my expertise.
