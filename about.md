I am a chemical engineer by schooling, an environmental scientist by experience, and published author by sheer will. I have a passion for research and writing about environmental science & technology, data analysis, and thermodynamics. All of my degrees are in Chemical Engineering (BS/MS/PHD) and I have navigated a diverse career as a NASA scientist studying how metals condense, as a postdoctoral fellow studying energy-society linkages, and as an environmental science professor doing scholarly work, and teaching courses in energy sustainability, atmospheric science, and environmental quantitative reasoning. Recently, I decided to leave my academic institution to pursue research full time, operating through my LLC, Random Walk Research. I'm particularly (but not exclusively) interested in ground and space-based sensing of the atmosphere and how it impacts weather, climate, and health.

### Relevant Education

**Undergraduate**<br>
BS Chemical Engineering; University of Rochester (1999)

**Graduate**<br>
PhD Chemical Engineering; University of Rochester (2007)

### Relevant Experience

#### NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (2000-2007)
* After my 1-year PhD residency requirement at UofR, I spent the balance of my PhD doing research at NASA-Goddard's Code 691 (Astrochemistry), first as a Graduate Student Researchers Program Fellow and then as a NASA Co-Op, which was an immediate path to federal employment.

#### University of Rochester and AHEAD Energy Corp (2007 - 2008)
* I left NASA in 2007 to start a family with my wife back in Rochester. During that year I worked with Ben Ebenhack, a lecturer at UofR and founder of AHEAD Energy, and that is where I began my journey studying energy systems, sustainability and energy transition theory. It's also where I taught my first class, _Sifting Through Trash: Myths and Facts of the Energy Crisis._

#### University of Southern Maine (2008 - 2022)
* After one year back in Rochester, we decided to move to Maine. I connected with USM's Department of Environmental Science and started out as a part-time research professor. I eventually received a full-time offer that was renewed until I applied for and received a promotion to Associate Research Professor.

#### Random Walk Research LLC (2022 - present)
* I established Random Walk Research to focus on my passion for fundamental research, applied R&D, and writing. My past experience has provided me a unique skillset to tackle science, engineering, technology, and policy problems. Send me an [email](mailto:daniel@randomwalkresearch.com) to discuss how Random Walk Research can help you with your project. 

### Useful Skills I Picked Up During My Journey
- Data analysis and Visualization with MS Excel (a way under-rated skill in my opinion)
- Technical Writing
- Literature Review
- Project Management
- Presenting and/or teaching diverse subject matter to informed and uninformed audiences
- Programming (BASIC, MathCad, a little C and FORTRAN)
- Protoype development

### What I'm learning Now
- Data Science Fundamentals (Python, R, SQL)
- IOT sensor systems
- CubeSats
- How to run a successful research and consulting business
